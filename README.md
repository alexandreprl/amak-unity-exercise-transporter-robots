<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Exercise

A room contains two area: the pick-up area in green and the drop-off area in red. Multiple boxes are present on the left and must be moved to the right.

To do that, a set of autonomous robots have been deployed. These robots can carry one box at a time and drop it anywhere.

The two areas are separated by a wall. To go from one side of the wall to the other, the robots can use two corridors: one at the top one at the bottom. The width of the corridor is such that only one robot can go through it. Also, two robots cannot be at the same location at the same time.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Fork the project
* Clone the forked version
* Open the project in Unity

### Exercise

The class __RobotAgent__ contains the behavior of a transporter robot. A basic version has been implemented in which they randomly move, pick a box if there is one and drop it if they are in the drop area.
Implement a cooperative behavior in which the robots coordinate to move the boxes to the drop area as fast as possible.
